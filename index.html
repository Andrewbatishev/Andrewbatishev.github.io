   <h2>Supreme</h2>
   <p class="fs">Supreme is a skateboarding shop and clothing brand established in New York City in April 1994. The brand caters to the skateboarding, hip hop and punk rock cultures, and youth culture at large. The brand produces clothes and accessories, and also manufactures skateboards that are collected like modern art. Its shoes, clothing, and accessories are sold extensively in the secondary market, as supply is limited and demand is high. The distinctive red box logo with "Supreme" in white Futura Heavy Oblique is largely based on Barbara Kruger's propaganda art.</p>

   <h2>History</h2>
   <p class="fs">The brand was founded by James Jebbia. Although he was born in the US, he lived in England until he was 19. The first Supreme store opened on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan in 1994. It was designed with skaters in mind with a unique design for the store layout: by arranging the clothes around the perimeter of the store, a large central space permitted skaters with backpacks to skate into the store and still feel comfortable. </p>

   In 2004, a second location was opened on North Fairfax Ave in Los Angeles, California, which is nearly double the size of the original New York City store and features an indoor skate bowl. Other locations include Paris Opening in March 2016, London Opening in September 2011, Tokyo (Harajuku, Daikanyama & Shibuya), Nagoya, Osaka, and Fukuoka. The additional locations emulate the original Lafayette Street store's design. Supreme stocks its own clothing label and Vans, Nike SB, Spitfire, Thrasher and Girl Distribution Company.</p>

   <div class="about">
      <p class="img">In April 1994, Supreme opened its doors on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan and became the home of New York City skate culture. At its core was the gang of rebellious young New York skaters and artists who became the store's staff, crew and customers. </p>
      <p class="img">Supreme grew to be the embodiment of the downtown culture, playing an integral part in its constant regeneration. Skaters, punks, hip-hop heads - the young counter culture at large - all gravitated towards Supreme. </p>
      <p class="img">While it grew into a downtown institution, Supreme established itself as a brand known for its quality, style and authenticity. </p>
      <p class="img">Over its eighteen year history, Supreme has worked with some of our generation's most groundbreaking designers, artists, photographers and musicians - all who have helped continue to define its unique identity and attitude.</p>
